Log-UDP-Server 0.01

This module enables you to receive messages (simple string or complicated
object) over a UDP socket. The message will be decoded with the specified
decoder/serializer and handed over to your specified handler.

The nice thing about UDP is that it is non-blocking in nature, so if the
listening server is down or unavailable, the messages from the client will
just be sent into the void. This means you can decide when you want your log
server to be up and running (if you don't want it all the time).
