NAME
    Log::UDP::Server - A simple way to receive and handle structured
    messages via UDP

VERSION
    version 0.40.0

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::UDP::Server;

        my $server = Log::UDP::Server->new( handler => sub { warn( $_[0] ); } );
        $server->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables you to receive a message (simple string or
    complicated object) over a UDP socket. An easy way to send a structured
    message is to use Log::UDP::Client. The message received will
    automatically be handled by the specified callback.

ATTRIBUTES
  handler : CodeRef
    The handler that is used to process each message as it is received.

  server_address : Str
    The address you want to listen on.

  server_port : Int
    The port you want to listen on.

  server_socket : IO::Socket::INET
    The listening socket used for communication.

METHODS
  run
    Starts the server and listens for incoming datagrams on the specified
    socket.

  START
    Initializes the "get_datagram" event on "server_socket".

EVENTS
  get_datagram
    Will execute the coderef in "handler" with the deserialized message as
    the first argument.

CONSTANTS
  $DATAGRAM_MAXLEN : Int
    Maximum UDP packet size. Set to 8192 bytes.
